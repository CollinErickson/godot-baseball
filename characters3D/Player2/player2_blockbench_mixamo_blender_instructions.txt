# Full character work process for Player2 (Blockbench, Mixamo, Blender, Godot)

The change for Player2 is switching to a two model system: one with all the animations, the other with the best model.
This will make it easier to make changes to only one without having to redo the entire process.

## Animated model

This will use a generic model but have all of the animations.

### Mixamo

- Go the character tab, select Y Bot. This should be used for all animations that we download.

- Look at the spreadsheet in this repo for Mixamo animations.
Find each of them in Mixamo, set the parameters as specified in the spreadsheet, and download.
This downloads the model and the animation, in Blender we will delete all but one model.
Put all these downloads in the Player2/mixamo folder.

### Blender

- Blender: install the Mixamo root add-on, make sure it's enabled (Preferences -> Add-ons).
I'm no longer using root bone since it messes up for some animations, but this imports animations.

- New blender project, then delete objects on right

- File -> Import -> (.glb) -> (select your character .glb file)

- Press 'n' to open the right toolbar, click on Mixamo tab. 

- On the Mixamo tab, select the folder with the animations. DON'T select "Insert root". Then click "Import Animations".
Make sure there is NOT a bone beneath the character (root bone).

- Delete all the armatures except one that has the body (downward triangle in the object list). Delete hierarchy if more than one have the body.
Don't worry about deleting the animations in the top right section, they will still show up in the animation section in the next step.
Now what I do is select Armature.001 through Armature.XXX and delete hierarchy.

- Click on Animation tab. Change "Dope sheet" to "Action editor."
Select an action ("Browse action" in bottom section, icon is almost like a face).
Click on the armature on the top right. Press the play button at the bottom and they should do the action.

- To delete duplicate animations: in top right file explorer, click on the image icon and change to "Blender File".
In the Action section, delete the duplicated animations.
I filtered for "Armature" (case sensitive), and delete all in the "Action" section.

- To get the animations to happen in place, install the "In Placer" Blender add-on and enable it.
On the animation tab, select each animation (one at a time) that should be in place, and click "Make it in place!" from the add-on.
Do this for most animations that move off center, including walking, standard run, Soccer Tackle, Running Slide, 
Goalkeeper Diving Save, Change Direction
Don't do it for some animations that move off center but return to where they start, including Rifle Punch, Baseball Pitching,
Baseball Hit, etc. You don't want to have their feet sliding when they should be stationary.

- File -> Export -> as .glb/.gltf -> save in correct folder as .glb file.
Save to Player2/animated/Player2Animated.glb.
The Blender session is saved as Player2/animated/blender/Player2Animated.blend (not anymore, too large a file size for git).

### Godot

- Double click on the file to get the load options.

- In Godot, click on .glb file in bottom left. It'll open a big box with the character and options. Change root type to CharacterBody3D.

- To allow for animation retargeting: click on Skeleton3D node, click on Retarget -> BoneMap, pick New BoneMap.
Click on "BoneMap" to expand it. Click on Profile, "New SkeletonProfileHumanoid". All of the joints should show up as green,
meaning that they have been mapped correctly.

- Click on each animation and update the Loop Mode to match what is in the spreadsheet.
Select each animation in the bottom left, change "Loop mode" to "Linear" (walking, running, idle), "None" (jump, throw, turn), or "Pingpong" (idle).

- Reimport
When reimporting, only new animations need to be updated.

- Only when creating for the first time:

	- In bottom left, right click on character glb file and pick "New Inherited Scene".

	- Click on AnimationPlayer, pick an animation, click play, and view on 3D page. They should walk forward.
We don't want them to walk forward, we want to do root motion.

	- Don't do any of the steps creating the AnimationTree or state machine, those will only be needed for the other character.

	- Click on the AnimationPlayer node, then the Animation option on the bottom of the screen. Click on the button "Animation" above the list of animations.
	- Click on Manage Animations. Rename the top of the list to be Player2AnimPack.
	- Click on the save button on the right of it, click on "Make Unique", it will do that for all aniations.
	- Click on the save button on the right of it again, this time click on "Save As" and save it to Player2/animated/Player2AnimPack.res.



## Unanimated model

This will have the best model, but not have the animations attached.

### Blockbench

- Create character model. Make sure there are enough loop cuts/body parts for animations to work.
Add textures for each body part. In Godot we will assign body parts colors, so textures don't really matter.

- Export as .ftx or .obj (which setting for texture? which file type?). Save in the blockbench folder.

- Do the same thing for separate bat model and glove model (mirrored for each handedness for glove).

### Mixamo

- Upload the character model.

- Download the animation for the Baseball Hit standard animation, the mirror of that, and the T-Pose.
We need this for attaching the bat in Blender.


### Blender

- Blender: install the Mixamo root add-on, make sure it's enabled (Preferences -> Add-ons).
I'm no longer using root bone since it messes up for some animations, but this imports animations.

- New blender: delete objects on right

- File -> Import -> (.glb) -> (select your character .glb file)

- Press 'n' to open the right toolbar, click on Mixamo tab. 

- On the Mixamo tab, select the folder with the animations. DON'T select "Insert root". Then click "Import Animations".
Make sure there is NOT a bone beneath the character (root bone).

- Delete all the armatures except one that has the body (downward triangle in the object list). Delete hierarchy if more than one have the body.

- Click on Animation tab. Change "Dope sheet" to "Action editor."
Select an action ("Browse action" in bottom section, icon is almost like a face).
Click on the armature on the top right. Press the play button at the bottom and they should do the action.

- To delete duplicate animations: in top right file explorer, click on the image icon and change to "Blender File".
In the Action section, delete the duplicated animations.
I filtered for "Armature" (case sensitive), and delete all in the "Action" section.

- Import the baseball bat object that we exported from Blockbench. Rename it to batL or batR.
Pick one of the animations for the swing.
Find a frame in the middle of the swing (maybe when the bat should be parallel or perpendicular to pitcher)
Steps from: https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/259286/how-to-combine-a-object-to-an-mixamo-character-animation-in-blender.
Select the bat. Hold down shift and select the armature (not in object list, but a part of the model).
Go to pose mode. Click on the forearm for the lead arm.
Press CTRL-P -> Bone.
Go back to Object Mode.
Move the bat into the position.
Last time for batR I used frame 11/39 of standard swing, scale (.01,.015,.01), position (-.6,-.4,.95), rotation (90,245,0).
Change the location of the bat. Change the size of the bat so that it looks right.
Make sure that this looks okay when playing the animation.
Repeat this process for the other handed swing animation. Match to the same frame, and adjust to the same size.

- Repeat the previous step but with the glove for each hand.
(Old, but maybe need to try again: Use a throwing animation. Attach again to the forearm.)
Use the T-Pose animation.
Turn off the hand and thumb for the glove hand to check if it looks right.
For gloveR, I used T-Pose, scale (.006,.006,.006), position (-.8, 0, 1.47), rotation (90,90,180).

- File -> Export -> as .glb/.gltf -> save in correct folder as .glb file.

## Godot

- In Godot, click on .glb file in bottom left. It'll open a big box with the character and options. Change root type to CharacterBody3D.
Click on the Skeleton3D node, then Retarget -> Bone Map, select "New BoneMap".
Click on BoneMap to expand it. Click on Profile, select "New SkeletonProfileHumanoid". Make sure that all the joints are green.
Select the AnimationPlayer node on the left, check the box for "Skip Import" since we won't use the animations from this one.
Reimport.
When reimporting, only new animations need to be updated.

- Only when creating for the first time:

	- In bottom left, right click on character glb file and pick "New Inherited Scene".
	
	- Add an AnimationPlayer child node.
	
	- In the Animation section on the bottom, click on the Animation button near the middle of the page. Click on "Manage Animations..."
	Click on "Load Library", select the AnimPack.res file that we saved earlier. Click on the save icon for the top row and select "Make Unique".

	- Click on AnimationPlayer, pick an animation, click play, and view on 3D page. They should walk forward.
We don't want them to walk forward, we want to do root motion.

	- Right click on Character node, add child node AnimationTree. On the right side, set "Anim player" to be the AnimationPlayer node.
Change Tree Root to a state machine.
DON'T do this anymore: Click RootMotion -> Track, assign to be the root bone (mixamorig_Root).

	- Add a RootMotionView node to the character, set Animation Path for that node to be the animation tree. You should see grid movement.

	- On bottom, click on AnimationTree, add nodes and links. Link Start to Idle, and Idle both directions to a BlendSpace2D.
On those links in Advance - Condition add "moving" for the link that leaves idle and "idle" for the link that enters idle.
