# Full character work process for Player1 (Blockbench, Mixamo, Blender, Godot)

## Blockbench

- Create character model. Make sure there are enough loop cuts/body parts for animations to work.
Add textures for each body part. In Godot we will assign body parts colors, so textures don't really matter.

- Export as .ftx or .obj (which setting for texture? which file type?)

- Do the same thing for separate bat model and glove model (mirrored for each handedness if needed).

## Mixamo

- Upload the character model.

- Look at the spreadsheet in this repo for Mixamo animations.
Find each of them in Mixamo, set the parameters as specified in the spreadsheet, and download.
This downloads the model and the animation, in Blender we will delete all but one model.
Put all these downloads in the same folder.

## Blender

- Blender: install the Mixamo root add-on, make sure it's enabled (Preferences -> Add-ons).
I'm no longer using root bone since it messes up for some animations, but this imports animations.

- New blender: delete objects on right

- File -> Import -> (.glb) -> (select your character .glb file)

- Press 'n' to open the right toolbar, click on Mixamo tab. 

- On the Mixamo tab, select the folder with the animations. DON'T select "Insert root". Then click "Import Animations".
Make sure there is NOT a bone beneath the character (root bone).

- Delete all the armatures except one that has the body (downward triangle in the object list). Delete hierarchy if more than one have the body.

- Click on Animation tab. Change "Dope sheet" to "Action editor."
Select an action ("Browse action" in bottom section, icon is almost like a face).
Click on the armature on the top right. Press the play button at the bottom and they should do the action.

- To delete duplicate animations: in top right file explorer, click on the image icon and change to "Blender File".
In the Action section, delete the duplicated animations.
I filtered for "Armature" (case sensitive), and delete all in the "Action" section.

- Import the baseball bat object that we exported from Blockbench. Rename it to batL or batR.
Pick one of the animations for the swing.
Find a frame in the middle of the swing (maybe when the bat should be parallel or perpendicular to pitcher).
Move the bat into the position.
Change the size of the bat so that it looks right.
Steps from: https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/259286/how-to-combine-a-object-to-an-mixamo-character-animation-in-blender.
Select the bat. Hold down shift and select the armature (not in object list, but a part of the model.
Go to pose mode. Click on the forearm for the lead arm.
Press CTRL-P -> Bone.
Make sure that this looks okay when playing the animation.
Repeat this process for the other handed swing animation. Match to the same frame, and adjust to the same size.

- Repeat the previous step but with the glove for each hand.
Use a throwing animation. Attach again to the forearm.
Turn off the hand and thumb for the glove hand to check if it looks right.

- File -> Export -> as .glb/.gltf -> save in correct folder as .glb file.

## Godot

- In Godot, click on .glb file in bottom left. It'll open a big box with the character and options. Change root type to CharacterBody3D.
Select each animation in the bottom left, change "Loop mode" to "Linear" (walking, running, idle), "None" (jump, throw, turn), or "Pingpong" (idle).
Reimport.
When reimporting, only new animations need to be updated.

- Only when creating for the first time:

	- In bottom left, right click on character glb file and pick "New Inherited Scene".

	- Click on AnimationPlayer, pick an animation, click play, and view on 3D page. They should walk forward.
We don't want them to walk forward, we want to do root motion.

	- Right click on Character node, add child node AnimationTree. On the right side, set "Anim player" to be the AnimationPlayer node.
Change Tree Root to a state machine.
DON'T do this anymore: Click RootMotion -> Track, assign to be the root bone (mixamorig_Root).

	- Add a RootMotionView node to the character, set Animation Path for that node to be the animation tree. You should see grid movement.

	- On bottom, click on AnimationTree, add nodes and links. Link Start to Idle, and Idle both directions to a BlendSpace2D.
On those links in Advance - Condition add "moving" for the link that leaves idle and "idle" for the link that enters idle.
