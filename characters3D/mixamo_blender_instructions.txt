# How to import character and animations from Mixamo through Blender into Godot

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq0hR2tIsRk&t=668s&ab_channel=FinePointCGI

- Blender: install the Mixamo root add-on, make sure it's enabled (Preferences -> Add-ons)

- New blender: delete objects on right

- File -> Import -> (.glb) -> (select your character .glb file)

- Press 'n' to open the right toolbar, click on Mixamo tab. 

- On the Mixamo tab, select the folder with the animations. Select "Insert root". Then click "Import Animations".
Make sure there is a bone beneath the character (root bone).

- Delete all the armatures except one that has the body (downward triangle in the object list). Delete hierarchy if more than one have the body.

- Click on Animation tab. Change "Dope sheet" to "Action editor."
Select an action ("Browse action" in bottom section, icon is almost like a face).
Click on the armature on the top right. Press the play button at the bottom and they should do the action.

- To delete duplicate animations: in top right file explorer, click on the image icon and change to "Blender File".
In the Action section, delete the duplicated animations.
I filtered for "Armature" (case sensitive), and delete all in the "Action" section.

- File -> Export -> as .glb/.gltf -> save in correct folder as .glb file.

- In Godot, click on .glb file in bottom left. It'll open a big box with the character and options. Change root type to CharacterBody3D.
Select each animation in the bottom left, change "Loop mode" to "Linear" (walking, running, idle), "None" (jump, throw, turn), or "Pingpong" (idle).
Reimport.

- In bottom left, right click on character glb file and pick "New Inherited Scene".

- Click on AnimationPlayer, pick an animation, click play, and view on 3D page. They should walk forward.
We don't want them to walk forward, we want to do root motion.

- Right click on Character node, add child node AnimationTree. On the right side, set "Anim player" to be the AnimationPlayer node.
Change Tree Root to a state machine.
Click RootMotion -> Track, assign to be the root bone (mixamorig_Root).

- Add a RootMotionView node to the character, set Animation Path for that node to be the animation tree. You should see grid movement.

- On bottom, click on AnimationTree, add nodes and links. Link Start to Idle, and Idle both directions to a BlendSpace2D.
On those links in Advance - Condition add "moving" for the link that leaves idle and "idle" for the link that enters idle.
